If there's one thing the internet needs, it's another blog. So after messing around with Jekyll and Github Pages for way longer than is reasonable, here we are.

Mostly or at least initially this will all be about low-level (some would say "hardware") performance issues, with a focus on Intel and x86 platforms. Feedback, questions and other comments are welcome by [email](mailto:travis.downs@gmail.com), [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/trav_downs), or as an issue on the github repository associated with the post.
