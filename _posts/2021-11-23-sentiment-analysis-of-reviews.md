Each review is labelled with either *Pos* or *Neg* to indicate whether the review has been assessed as *positive* or *negative* in the sentiment it expresses. You should treat these labels as a reliable indicator of sentiment. You can assume that there are no neutral reviews. There are 1,382 reviews in the CSV file in total, 691 of which are positive and 691 of which are negative.

### The Task

In a Jupyter notebook, implement a Naïve Bayes classifier using 80% (1106) of the reviews as training data. The training data should be selected at random from the full dataset. Test your classifier using the remaining 20% (276) of the reviews and report the classifier’s performance using a confusion matrix.
It is important that you avoid issues of data leakage, meaning that your classifier should only be trained using data that it has access to from within the training data set. If there are words that only appear in the test data they should not be part of the classifier. You will need to make sure that your code is able to deal with encountering words in the test data that the classifier has not seen in the training data. It is up to you to decide how you will handle this.
Your code will need to read the review data CSV file provided. 

You will need to perform some clean up of the data before using it in your classifier. This should include:

- Identifying and excluding all punctuation and words that are not likely to affect sentiment (e.g. stopwords). As an example, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python has lists of common stopwords that you may wish to use, but you are also free to find and use other libraries or tools for this.
- Ensuring that remaining words are not case sensitive (i.e. the classifier should not distinguish upper/lower case characters).

Your sentiment classifier should use a bag of words technique, in which you build a vocabulary of individual words that appear in the dataset once it has been cleaned up.
You should attempt to treat minor variations of a word (e.g. ‘fault’, ‘faults’ and ‘faulty’) as instances of the same word (e.g. ‘fault’) when you are using them in your classifier. You should investigate and implement stemming as a way of doing this.

For each review you should create a vector as input for your classifier, containing EITHER binary values indicating whether a word/stem occurs in the review OR a numerical count of the number of times each word/stem appears. As described above, vectors that are used to train the classifier should only include words that appear in the training data (and not words that only exist within the test data).
Note: You do not need to code everything required from scratch. For this lab exercise you are encouraged to make use of existing libraries for all parts of the tasks. For example, you may find the MultinomialNB classifier in scikit.learn and natural language processing tools such as NLTK and spaCy useful for this task.
It is also important to note that there is no single correct answer in terms of the output and performance of your classifier. This will depend on the choices you make about how you deal with the data at each stage of the process – your markers will not be looking for a specific level of performance, rather that you have taken appropriate steps and implemented them correctly.

Text Analysis is a major application field for machine learning algorithms. However the raw data, a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with a fixed size rather than the raw text documents with variable length.

In order to address this, scikit-learn provides utilities for the most common ways to extract numerical features from text content, namely:

- **Tokenizing** strings and giving an integer id for each possible token, for instance by using white-spaces and punctuation as token separators.

- **Counting** the occurrences of tokens in each document.

- **Normalizing** and weighting with diminishing importance tokens that occur in the majority of samples / documents.

In this scheme, features and samples are defined as follows:

- Each *individual token occurrence frequency* (normalized or not) is treated as a feature.

- The vector of all the token frequencies for a given document is considered a multivariate sample.

A corpus of documents can thus be represented by a matrix with one row per document and one column per token (e.g. word) occurring in the corpus.

We call *vectorization* the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. This specific strategy (tokenization, counting and normalization) is called the Bag of Words or *“Bag of n-grams”* representation. Documents are described by word occurrences while completely ignoring the relative position information of the words in the document.

Stop words are words like “and”, “the”, “him”, which are presumed to be uninformative in representing the content of a text, and which may be removed to avoid them being construed as signal for prediction. Sometimes, however, similar words are useful for prediction, such as in classifying writing style or personality.

### Preprocessing
Steps Taken:
- Remove Punctuation and Digits and make lowercase, Remove words < len(3)
- Tokenize the words, and remove stopwords
- Stem the words




```python
def process_text(filename):
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
    # Remove Punctuation and Digits and make lowercase, Remove words < len(3)
    list_of_chars_and_digits = string.punctuation + string.digits
    df['remove_punc_and_digits'] = df['Review'].str.replace(f"[{list_of_chars_and_digits}]", " ", regex=True).apply(str.lower).str.findall("\w{3,}").str.join(" ")

    # Tokenize the words, and remove stopwords
    df['word_tokens'] = df['remove_punc_and_digits'].apply(nltk.word_tokenize)
    df['remove_stopwords'] = df['word_tokens'].apply(lambda x: [word for word in x if word not in stop_words]) 
    df['remove_stopwords_count'] = df['remove_stopwords'].apply(Counter)
    
    # Stem the words
    ps = PorterStemmer()
    df['stemmed'] = df['remove_stopwords'].apply(lambda x: [ps.stem(word) for word in x])
    df['stemmed_count'] = df['stemmed'].apply(Counter)
    
    # Final processed sentence
    df['stemmed_sentence'] = df['stemmed'].str.join(' ')
    return df

df = process_text('car_reviews.csv')
df

     In 1992 we bought a new Taurus and we really loved it  So in 1999 we decided to try a new Taurus  I did not care for the style of the newer version  but bought it anyway I do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other one  Thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room  I do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting It drives nice and has good pick up  But you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficult  It has a very small gas tank I would not buy a Taurus if I had it to do over  I would rather have my 1992 back  I don t think the style is as nice as the the 1992  and it was a mistake to change the style  In less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire

### Bag of Words 

The bag-of-words model is very simple to understand and implement and offers a lot of flexibility for customization on your specific text data.

It has been used with great success on prediction problems like language modeling and documentation classification.

Nevertheless, it suffers from some shortcomings, such as:

- **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary requires careful design, most specifically in order to manage the size, which impacts the sparsity of the document representations.
- **Sparsity**: Sparse representations are harder to model both for computational reasons (space and time complexity) and also for information reasons, where the challenge is for the models to harness so little information in such a large representational space.
- **Meaning**: Discarding word order ignores the context, and in turn meaning of words in the document (semantics). Context and meaning can offer a lot to the model, that if modeled could tell the difference between the same words differently arranged (“this is interesting” vs “is this interesting”), synonyms (“old bike” vs “used bike”), and much more.

## Avoiding Data Leakage

- **fit_transform()** is used on the training data so that we can scale the training data and also learn the transformation parameters of that data. 
These learned parameters are then used to transform our test data.

- Using the **transform()** method we can use the same transformation calculated from our training data to transform our test data. Thus, the parameters learned by our model using the training data will help us to transform our test data. In this case, out of vocabulary words are avoided.

More about the difference between **fit_transform()** and **transform()** can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-and-why-behind-fit-transform-vs-transform-in-scikit-learn-78f915cf96fe).



```python
vect = CountVectorizer()

### Confusion Matrix for MultinomialNB()

Classification report explained:

- The recall means "how many of this class you find over the whole number of elements of this class"
- The precision will be "how many are correctly classified among that class"
- The f1-score is the harmonic mean between precision & recall
- The support is the number of occurence of the given class in your dataset 
- 0 stands for 'Negative'
- 1 stands for 'Positive'

Confusion Matrix:
$$\begin{bmatrix} TN & FP \\ FN & TP \end{bmatrix}$$

The best confusion matrix has a low:
- False Positive: You predicted positive and it’s false. (Type 1 Error)
- False Negative: You predicted negative and it’s false. (Type 2 Error)

and a high:
- True Positive: You predicted positive and it’s true.
- True Negative: You predicted negative and it’s true.

Essentially you want most of your values to lie along the trace of the matrix.

### Improve the Model

Identify and research a way to improve on the solution, such that you would expect to do better at classifying the sentiment of the reviews.
You may either:
- Identify an alternative classification algorithm, or
- Apply modifications to the Naïve Bayes implementation, for example trying different classification of different size n-grams (multi-word phrases). Implement this improvement and compare the results to your initial Naïve Bayes classifier.



### Plans for Improvement

- The first step to improve a model is the correct choice of hyperparameters. Using the **KFold()** and **GridSearch()** classes we can optimise the various parameters associated with the model **MultinomialNB()**. Naive Bayes models only have the alpha parameter to optimise, so we begin across a range of values.
- Other factors such as word vectorising in the pre-processing stage, rather than the bag of words approach could yield different results.
- Using **DictVectorizer()** could also improve the model, from the stemmed_counts column in preprocessing.
- **TfidVectorizer()** is likely to vastly improve the model.
- Words which appear only once don't help classification at all, if only because they can never be matched again. More generally, words which appear rarely are more likely to appear by chance, so using them as features causes overfitting.



### Hyperparameter Tuning using KFold() and GridSearch()

Implemented improvements:
- Hyperparameter tuning for \\( \alpha \\).

We use the **KFold()** and **GridSearch()** to find the optimal \\( \alpha \\) value for our model.


```python
def param_tuning(X_train):
    # K-fold cross validation
    cv = KFold(n_splits=5) 
    model = MultinomialNB()
    # Hyperparameters
    parameters = {'alpha':alpha_values}
    # Gridsearch
    clf = GridSearchCV(model, parameters, cv=cv, scoring='roc_auc', return_train_score=True, verbose=1)
    # Fit the Model
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return clf

alpha_values = [0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001,0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000]
clf = param_tuning(X_train_bow)
# Extract stats for plotting
train_auc = clf.cv_results_['mean_train_score']
train_auc_std = clf.cv_results_['std_train_score']
cv_auc = clf.cv_results_['mean_test_score'] 
cv_auc_std = clf.cv_results_['std_test_score']
best_alpha = clf.best_params_['alpha']
```

    Fitting 5 folds for each of 11 candidates, totalling 55 fits


Below is a plot displaying all of the respective K-folds and fitted \\( \alpha \\) values, with the best \\( \alpha \\) value obtained around \\( 1 \\).


```python
def plot_error():
    alpha_values_lst = [np.log(x) for x in alpha_values]

    plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10))
    plt.plot(alpha_values_lst, train_auc, label='Train AUC')
    plt.gca().fill_between(alpha_values_lst,train_auc - train_auc_std,train_auc + train_auc_std,alpha=0.2,color='darkblue')

    plt.plot(alpha_values_lst, cv_auc, label='CV AUC')
    plt.gca().fill_between(alpha_values_lst,cv_auc - cv_auc_std,cv_auc + cv_auc_std,alpha=0.2,color='darkorange')

    plt.scatter(alpha_values_lst, train_auc, label='Train AUC points')
    plt.scatter(alpha_values_lst, cv_auc, label='CV AUC points')

    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel("Alpha")
    plt.ylabel("AUC")
    plt.show()

    print("Best cross-validation score: {:.3f}".format(clf.best_score_))
    print('The best alpha from gridsearch :',best_alpha)

### Preprocessing Improvement with Hyperparameter Tuning (Bag of Words)
Implemented improvements:
- Preprocessed stemmed words with \\( N \\) occurrences dropped.
- Hyperparameter tuning for \\( \alpha \\).

### Naive Bayes Considerations

- Naive Bayes is very sensitive to overfitting since it considers all the features independently of each other.
- It's also quite likely that the final number of features (words) is too high with respect to the number of instances. A low ratio instances/words causes overfitting.
The solution is to filter out words which occur less than \\( N \\) times in the data. Maybe try with several values of \\( N \\), starting with \\( N=2 \\).


```python
def remove_word_occurrences(df, N=2):
    # Extra reduction step to remove words that occur less than N times.
    total_rows = len(df)
    df['reduced_stem_count'] = [{k:v for k,v in df['stemmed_count'][row].items() if v > N} for row in range(total_rows)]
    df['reduced_stemmed'] = [[k for k in df['reduced_stem_count'][row]] for row in range(total_rows)]
    df['reduced_stemmed_sentence'] = [' '.join(i) for i in df['reduced_stemmed']]
    return df

df = process_text('car_reviews.csv')
df = remove_word_occurrences(df, N=2)

### Improvements Using TfidVectorizer()

A problem with scoring word frequency is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content” to the model as rarer but perhaps domain specific words.

One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents, so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized.

This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:

- **Term Frequency**: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.
- **Inverse Document Frequency**: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.
The scores are a weighting where not all words are equally as important or interesting.

The scores have the effect of highlighting words that are distinct (contain useful information) in a given document.



Implemented improvements:
- Preprocessed stemmed words with \\( N \\) occurrences dropped.
- Hyperparameter tuning for \\( \alpha \\).
- Use of the **TfidVectorizer()** instead of the **CountVectorizer()**


The sklearn class [TfidVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) might have a small performance increase as opposed to the [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) (Bag of Words), which uses produces a sparse representation of the counts using scipy.sparse.csr_matrix. 


```python
# Sentiment target, convert to 1 for pos, 0 for neg
y_tf = df['Sentiment'].replace('Pos', 1).replace('Neg', 0)
# Fully processed sentence
X_tf = df['stemmed_sentence']

# Break off validation set from training data
X_train_tf, X_test_tf, y_train_tf, y_test_tf = train_test_split(X_tf, y_tf, 
                                        train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2,
                                        random_state=0)


tf_idf_vect = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), min_df=10)
# Prevent data leakage
X_train_tf = tf_idf_vect.fit_transform(X_train_tf)
X_test_tf = tf_idf_vect.transform(X_test_tf)

### Using the ComplementNB() Model
Implemented potential improvements:
- Preprocessed stemmed words with \\( N \\) occurrences dropped.
- Hyperparameter tuning for \\( \alpha \\).
- Use of the **TfidVectorizer()** instead of the **CountVectorizer()**
- Use of the **ComplementNB()** instead of the **MultiNomialNB()**

**ComplementNB()** implements the complement naive Bayes (CNB) algorithm. CNB is an adaptation of the standard multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm that is particularly suited for imbalanced data sets. Specifically, CNB uses statistics from the complement of each class to compute the model’s weights. The inventors of CNB show empirically that the parameter estimates for CNB are more stable than those for MNB. Further, CNB regularly outperforms MNB (often by a considerable margin) on text classification tasks.




```python
def matrix_comp(X_train,y_train,X_test,y_test):

    # Run the model on the training set
    model = ComplementNB(alpha=10)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Test the model with the test set
    predict = model.predict(X_test)

    # Save the model
    pickle.dump(model, open('model.pkl','wb'))

    # Define the confusion matrix
    conf_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, predict)
    print('Confusion Matrix:\n')
    print(conf_mat)

    # Get the classification report
    report = classification_report(y_test,predict)

### Using DictVectorizer()
Implemented potential improvements:
- Preprocessed stemmed words with \\( N \\) occurrences dropped.
- Hyperparameter tuning for \\( \alpha \\).
- Use of the **DictVectorizer()** instead of the **CountVectorizer()** and **TfidVectorizer()**.
- Use of **MultiNomialNB()** for the model.


```python
dv = DictVectorizer(sparse=False)
X_dv = dv.fit_transform(df['reduced_stem_count'])
# Sentiment target, convert to 1 for pos, 0 for neg
y_dv = df['Sentiment'].replace('Pos', 1).replace('Neg', 0)
# Break off validation set from training data
X_train_dv, X_test_dv, y_train_dv, y_test_dv = train_test_split(X_dv, y_dv, 
                                        train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2,
                                        random_state=0)
matrix(X_train_dv, y_train_dv, X_test_dv, y_test_dv, alpha=1)

## Conclusions

Classification report explained:

- The recall means "how many of this class you find over the whole number of elements of this class"
- The precision will be "how many are correctly classified among that class"
- The f1-score is the harmonic mean between precision & recall
- The support is the number of occurence of the given class in your dataset 
- 0 stands for 'Negative'
- 1 stands for 'Positive'

Confusion Matrix:
$$\begin{bmatrix} TN & FP \\ FN & TP \end{bmatrix}$$

The best confusion matrix has a low:
- False Positive: You predicted positive and it’s false. (Type 1 Error)
- False Negative: You predicted negative and it’s false. (Type 2 Error)

and a high:
- True Positive: You predicted positive and it’s true.
- True Negative: You predicted negative and it’s true.

For this use case, the **TfidVectorizer()** with \\( \alpha=10 \\) allows our model **MultinomialNB()** to perform better.


### - Model: ComplementNB()

[ComplementNB()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.ComplementNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.ComplementNB) sees a slight decrease in precision, but it shines with imbalanced data sets, and ours is fairly balanced! Should this not be the case with other test train splits, this model should beat [MultinomialNB()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB).

Implemented potential improvements:
- Preprocessed stemmed words with \\( N<2 \\) occurrences dropped.
- Hyperparameter tuning for \\( \alpha \\).
- Use of the **TfidVectorizer()** instead of the **CountVectorizer()**
- Use of the **ComplementNB()** instead of the **MultiNomialNB()**
